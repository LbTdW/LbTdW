## On my Person 👋

📚 I have been immersing myself in the field of Deep Learning for more than six years now, both in my studies, at work, and privately. Through my various jobs, I have acquired a broad spectrum of skills in this area. 
While the focus at the German Aerospace Agency (DLR) was on analytical engagement and discussion, the focus of my current job is to generate value by the means of real-life Deep Learning applications.

🎭 In daily teamwork, I excel in a high degree of autonomy, self-reflection, and attentiveness. In my current position, communication between the parties involved as well as the presentation of results both to the employees, the product owner, and the customer is a key skill that I enjoy practicing very much. I prefer to work in an agile way and I am able to contribute to the required team roles depending on the setup.
